    <p class="lead">“Well-crafted and sturdy, farmhouses are generally built to last and withstand for ages. These types of homes increased productivity on the farm by allowing the farmers to arrive on their farm workspace earlier, thanks to its close proximity. Since they are designed for survival, farmhouses often have a decent supply of food, supplies and other necessities that serve the essentials of the homeowner.

        <p class="wedge">The farmhouse can be dated back to the expansive fields of Scandinavia and Germany in Europe. They were most popular among the working-class families. Their designs made their way across the seas, first appearing along the countryside of Quebec and Ontario. Early settlers and pioneers of the Colonial period brought this new architecture to the east coast, thus the beginnings of the Cape Cod and Colonial styles. Since the farmhouse design was easily built by hand and time was as valuable as money, it rapidly spread to the West during the 1700s.</p>



        <p class="wedge">The 1930s in the United States brought about a new era for the American Farmhouse. Prior to this decade, farmhouses and country living were incredibly harsh with no running water or electricity. The Great Depression and a debilitating drought made it a struggle for farmers to keep their lands functioning. Farmhouses had to rely on wood burning stoves, kerosene lamps and outhouses. City dwellers enjoyed the luxury of electricity that produced proper lighting and useful appliances. As the 1930s progressed, the government connected the surrounding farms to the electricity grid, supplying them with the means for electric stoves and lights. Electric pumps could now be installed to provide indoor plumbing and running water to rural farmhouses. This was a huge advancement to the farmhouse design as well as greatly improved hygiene and health to rural living. Additionally, electricity encouraged the use of radios in country life. Families would gather for radio entertainment as well as essential news and farming advice.

        <p class="wedge">The early American farmhouses were simply built homes with wooden clapboard siding and constructed on flat land. Many were built with porches that also functioned as outdoor storage space. Since close proximity to water was extremely important, farmhouses were often located next to lakes or rivers. The interiors were quite cramped with low ceilings, small doors and narrow stairways. However, the kitchens were usually more spacious and provided ample workspace, despite the lack of cabinets.

        <p class="wedge">Modern farmhouses of today’s era behave as a nostalgic outlook of home design and an ode to America’s past. New homeowners have had increased interest with the classic American Farmhouse, mostly thanks to its appealing sentimental qualities. purpose rooms. Even though the conveniences of bathrooms, larger closets and laundry rooms have thrown off the symmetrical balance of windows and doors, the farmhouse of today still captures the timeless fashion of country grace, charm, and love of the land.From the simple times of early America to the present era of electronic and architectural advancement, the farmhouse design still remains popular among many people in the United States. They successfully merge the old with the new and are constantly evolving to include new and fresh ideas.
